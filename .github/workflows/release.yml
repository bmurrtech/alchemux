# PyPI release: build sdist + wheel on release tag push only; publish via Trusted Publishing (OIDC).
# Runs only when a version tag is pushed (e.g. v0.1.1-rc1, v1.0.0). Branch pushes do not trigger this.
# One-time setup: create PyPI project "alchemux" and configure Trusted Publishing
# for this repo (see https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/).
