# End User Terms for Official Releases
**Last Updated:** [[2025-12-27]]

These terms (“Release Terms”) apply **only** to the official prebuilt releases and binaries distributed by the project’s maintainer(s) (“Distributor”). The source code in this repository is licensed under the **Apache License 2.0** (`LICENSE`). These Release Terms do **not** change the Apache License 2.0 for the source code; they are an additional agreement that applies when you choose to use an official release.

## 1) Acceptance
By downloading, installing, running, or using an official release, you agree to these Release Terms.

The official release may require an explicit acknowledgement before enabling functionality (for example: typing “I AGREE”, using `--accept-eula`, or setting an environment variable). If you do not agree, do not use the official release.

## 2) Authorized Use Only; Your Responsibilities
You are solely responsible for ensuring you have the legal right and authorization to access, process, store, or share any content used with the Software and for complying with all applicable laws and third-party terms (including any platform or service terms you interact with).

You represent and warrant that you:
- have all necessary rights and permissions for any content you access or process using the Software;
- will comply with all applicable laws and regulations; and
- will comply with third-party terms and policies applicable to any service you access.

## 3) Prohibited Conduct
You will not use the Software to:
- violate any law or third-party rights;
- bypass DRM, paywalls, access controls, authentication, encryption, or other technical protection measures; or
- distribute, publish, retransmit, or share content you are not authorized to share.

## 4) No Support for Unlawful Use
Distributor does not provide instructions or support intended to facilitate unlawful use or violation of third-party terms.

## 5) Assumption of Risk
You understand that use of the Software may involve interaction with third-party services and processing of content. You assume all risks arising from your use, including any claims by third parties relating to content you access, process, store, transmit, or share.

## 6) Indemnification (Duty to Defend; Control of Defense)
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Distributor and contributors from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or related to:
(a) your use of the official release;
(b) your violation of these Release Terms, any law, or any third-party terms; or
(c) any content you access, process, store, distribute, publish, transmit, or share using the Software.

Distributor may, at its option, assume control of the defense and settlement of any claim subject to indemnification, and you agree to cooperate. You may not settle any claim in a manner that imposes liability or obligations on Distributor or contributors without prior written consent.

## 7) Disclaimers
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED **“AS IS”** AND **“AS AVAILABLE.”** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DISTRIBUTOR AND CONTRIBUTORS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. DISTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR UNINTERRUPTED.

## 8) Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW:
- DISTRIBUTOR AND CONTRIBUTORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, GOODWILL, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY.
- DISTRIBUTOR’S AND CONTRIBUTORS’ TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE OFFICIAL RELEASE WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID (IF ANY) TO OBTAIN THE OFFICIAL RELEASE.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain exclusions or limitations; in those jurisdictions, liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

## 9) Termination
Your permission to use the official release terminates automatically if you violate these Release Terms. Upon termination, you must stop using the official release and destroy copies under your control, except where prohibited by law.

## 10) Severability
If any provision is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect to the maximum extent permitted.
